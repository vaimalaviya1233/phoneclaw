**PhoneClaw**
PhoneClaw is an Android automation app that runs on-device workflows and lets you generate automation logic at runtime using **ClawScript**, a JavaScript-based scripting language built into the app.

PhoneClaw is inspired by Claude Bot/Claude Code and attempts to rebuild the agent loop for android phones natively to act as your personal assistant with access to all your apps.

**What It Can Do**
- Automate multi-step app workflows on Android using the Accessibility service.
- Generate scripts at runtime for flexible, adaptive automations.
- Use vision-assisted UI targeting to click controls without hardcoded coordinates.
- Read visible on-screen text and values for branching, validation, and handoffs.
- Schedule automations with cron-like timing for recurring tasks.
- Chain actions across apps (browser, email, media, messaging) inside a single flow.
- Build flows that adapt to different device sizes, layouts, and language settings.

**ClawScript**
ClawScript runs inside PhoneClaw using an embedded JS engine and exposes helper functions for automation, scheduling, and screen understanding. It is designed for fast iteration: write or generate small scripts at runtime, execute them immediately, and adjust based on UI feedback.

**ClawScript API (Core Helpers)**
- `speakText(text)` — Reads out text using on-device TTS to confirm state or provide progress.
- `delay(ms)` — Pauses execution for a specific number of milliseconds.
- `schedule(task, cronExpression)` — Registers a task string to run on a cron-like schedule.
- `clearSchedule()` — Removes all scheduled tasks.
- `magicClicker(description)` — Finds a UI element by natural-language description and taps it.
- `magicScraper(description)` — Answers a targeted question about what is visible on screen.
- `sendAgentEmail(to, subject, message)` — Sends an email from the device for notifications or handoffs.
- `safeInt(value, defaultVal)` — Safely parses values to integers with a fallback.

**magicClicker(description)**
- Uses a screenshot plus vision to locate a target described in plain language.
- Taps the best-matching UI element through the Accessibility service.
- Best for repeatable flows where the UI layout may shift between devices.

**magicScraper(description)**
- Uses a screenshot plus vision to answer a targeted question about what is visible.
- Returns a concise string that you can parse or branch on in your script.
- Best for reading text like OTP codes, status labels, or field values.

**Example Script**
```js
magicClicker("Create account")
delay(1500)
magicClicker("Email address field")
// ... type text via your own input helpers
magicClicker("Next")
const otp = magicScraper("The 2FA code shown in the SMS notification")
// ... submit otp
```

**Setup**
- Provide your Moondream auth token via Gradle properties (kept out of git):

```properties
# local.properties (project root) OR ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
MOONDREAM_AUTH=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

**Security**
- Do not commit API keys or service credentials. Use `local.properties` or your global Gradle properties for secrets.
